Steps:
1. connect camera to python
2. write raster scan code
3. camera control + stage control

Imaga Analysis:
1. transform matlab code in python 




Resources:
1. connects to camera/motor: https://github.com/qpit/thorlabs_apt 


Observations:
1. the cv countour is not very accurate even after trying to tune the hyperparameters
2. Even so, each image will have its own set of hyperparameters that works well. This is a problem with generalization with other images.
2. Next step might be exploring ways to preprocess the images trying to make it work better
